# Basic information
Every api path should start with /api/v1 and after that /{url} to the desired url of the api.
For authorization we are using JWT so for authorization for most of the api urls you need a JWT token generated by the /api/v1/login post request (more details below).

# Api description
(Every path starts with /api/v1)

## /register
This api endpoint is for registering new users. A client has to send a POST request with the user data fromatted like:
```
{   
    "username": "Example",
    "password": "Password",
    "email": "example@example.com",
    "streak": 0
}
```
### Responses
 * ***201*** - when the user is successfully created, will return the created user in the body of the request.
 * ***400*** - on a bad request, this means the username has illegal characters in it (like spaces " ") or the email is incorrect (is without @ or dots in the site part) or the user already exists in the database. The details for why there was an error should be written in the response body.

## /login
This is the api endpoint for login in for alreadu existsing users. If successful it should return a JWT token, which the client has to save and for every other request should give it in the ***Authorization*** part of the http request header. A client has to send a POST request with minimal info that is below:
```
{   
    "username": "Example",
    "password": "Password",
}
```
### Responses
 * ***202*** - when the user is successfully authenticated based on the info in the request body. It will return a JWT token for every other authentication request for this site.
 * ***400*** - when the user provided doesn't exist in the database of the application.
 * ***403*** - when the password provided doesn't match the password stored in the database.
